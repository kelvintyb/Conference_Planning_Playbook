# Conference Planning Playbook (WIP)

This Conference Planning Playbook is started by [@winstonyw](https://twitter.com/winstonyw) who's been running [@reddotrubyconf](https://twitter.com/reddotrubyconf) since 2013,
and mainly details his process and experience in executing the conference.

RedDotRubyConf (RDRC) started in 2011 and is held annually in Singapore. It is South East Asia's biggest Ruby conference.
Every year, RDRC brings 350+ Rubyists of all levels together for an intimate sharing of the latest technical knowledge.

Past speakers of RDRC includes Matz, Koichi Sasada, Jim Weirich, Aaron Patterson, Linda Liukas, Laurent Sansonetti and many more:

## Prelude

:warning: Conference organization is really a full time job. It will take up A LOT of your time. :heart:

Personally, I believe that it's important to abide by consistency and integrity when planning the conference as you will have to face a lot of strange situations with sponsorships, ticketing etc.

Hence it's good to have identical replies to all parties to avoid situations where fairness becomes an issue.

In fact, it's not only about the conference. You should be consistent and have integrity in life too. :smile:

## 6 Months Before Conference

### Gather Your Team

You want folks who are meticulous, motivated, can't stop thinking about the community and get things done on your team.

### Conference Format

Decide the conference format:

#### Days

How many days? Will you have enough speakers/audience? Recommendation is to 1 day for a new conference.

#### Tracks

How many tracks? Will you have enough speakers/audience? Is the audience getting value from the different tracks?

#### Keynotes

Plan the schedule and decide on slots for keynotes.

#### Call-for-Proposal (CFP)

Plan the schedule and decide on slots for CFP talks. How much time for each talk?

### Conference Dates

Decide the conference dates:

#### Days of Week

RDRC started as a Friday, Saturday event, but was eventually moved to Thursday and Friday.

#### Season

Any considerations for weather? Singapore is a tropic country and generally hot throughout.

In Singapore, December/January has its fair share of rain, and August/September is susceptible to haze..

#### Clashes

Any major events in your country? Is it complementary to have the conference around the dates or better to avoid them?

Any other local or international conferences around the same dates. Check rubyconferences.org.

### Conference Venue

Source for a venue. Considerations include:

#### Cost

Venues can easily take up a huge chunk of your budget.

Some venues provides catering as well which explains the higher cost. Going ala-carte might help bring the cost down.

#### Location

Is it accessible? Preferably near a MRT station.

#### Seats

How are the seat?s Attendees sit for 5-6 hours. Hopefully they are comfortable.

#### Electricity

Possible to have charging points for laptops and phones?

#### Space

Is there enough space outside the auditorium for meals and serendipitous mingling?

#### Wifi?

That's really debatable. Pick a side:

- "This is a conference for developers and we all need internet".
- "This is a conference. You should listen to the speakers".

Do what's within your budget. Setting up wifi can sometimes be costly.

### Speaker Sponsorships

What can you sponsor for your Keynote speakers, or CFP speakers:

#### Flights

Any restrictions on Flights Class (Economy, Business)? Any cap on total cost?

#### Accommodation

How many nights?

#### Mode of Reimbursement

How will the $ be transferred?

### Contact Keynote Speakers

Good/Popular speakers are booked way in advance. Seriously.

You might even want to ping them 7-8 months in advance.

### Start Marketing

Tell the Ruby community! Tweet it! Facebook it!

### Budgeting

Coming Soon.. But something to think about: Who's absorbing the lost if turnout is bad?

---

## 5 Months Before Conference

### Call-for-Proposals

Setup a CFP website. Google Doc/Forms is fine. Trying out https://github.com/rubycentral/cfp-app for RDRC 2016.

### Website

Things that I usually put up at this stage:

- Dates and Location
- Ticketing Link
- Keynote Speakers
- Code of Conduct
- Sponsorship Details
- Links like Facebook, Twitter etc.

### Sponsor Kit

You'll want to have your sponsor kit ready too that list details for each sponsorship.

### Ticketing

Things to consider:

#### Platform

In 2013, we hand-rolled our own. In 2014, Peatix. In 2015, EventBrite.

Ideally, the platform should have/be able to:

- Register one or multiple attendees with a single account (Peatix can't do that)
- Flexible pricing options
  - Discounts (Early Bird / Percentage / Bundles)
  - Closes ticketing by Time or Number
- Easy registration on the day of the event
- Analytics

#### Price

How much are you pricing the ticket? Early Bird? Percentage off via Discount Codes?

**Prices should be tiered according to time**.

Early Birds should have the biggest discount, and not those who buy tickets 1-2 weeks before the conference.

#### Schedule

What is the schedule of selling tickets? Sale through event? Flash sale?

What is the schedule of releasing the discounts?

### Attendees Information

You might want to collect some information to generate analytics like [this](http://winstonyw.com/assets/images/rdrc14-infographics.jpg) and [this](http://winstonyw.com/assets/images/rdrc15-infographics.jpg).

At least it's stats which you can use to promote to sponsors for the following year.

## 4, 3 Months Before Conference

### Call-for-Proposal (CFP)

CFP should be (almost?) done and you can start to review and reach out to the speakers to plan the conference schedule!

### Fringe Activities

Will there be fringe activities around the conference? Meetups? Workshops?

These are additional avenues to mingle and network with folks visiting from overseas.

### Marketing

Update your website.

Ping your friends and user groups again to buy tickets before any discounts expire.

### After Party

Will the conference have Before/After Parties? Time to checkout those spots.

### Swag

Get T-shirt design ready! Think about other swag for your attendees.

### Logistics

Logistics that you should also look into in these two months:

- Venue Setup
- Food (Breakfast/Lunch/Tea) and Coffee/Tea
- Video
- Swag providers

---

## 2, 1 Months Before Conference

### Marketing

NEVER STOP!

### Accommodation for Speakers

Speakers should be confirmed by this time, and flights mostly booked.

Now you can book accommodation for speakers whose accommodation is sponsored.

### Printing

Start printing your T-shirts, programs, posters and stickers.

### Plan Actual Day Logistics

#### Emcee/Host

Someone who knows the speakers (and what they are talking about).

#### Cleaners

The mess that 300 people generate can be pretty crazy.

#### Venue Setup

How's the venue going to look like?

#### Registrations

Who's doing the registrations? You need to take care of laggards too.

My preference leans towards hiring part-timers for this, because anyone in the community
should be in the auditorium listening and learning from all the great talks,
and not be stuck at the registration table.

### Be Paranoid

Think about everything and anything. Every small detail counts. Do it with your heart.

Hopefully then you'll have an event that's comfortable, fun and insightful for everyone! Good Luck! ::four_leaf_clover::
